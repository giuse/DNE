# Deep Neuroevolution experiments

This project collects a set of neuroevolution experiments with/towards deep networks.

## Installation

First make sure the OpenAI Gym is pip-installed, [instructions here](https://github.com/openai/gym).  
You will also need the [GVGAI_GYM](https://github.com/rubenrtorrado/GVGAI_GYM) to access GVGAI environments.

Clone this repository, then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

    bundle exec ruby experiments/cartpole.rb

## Contributing
